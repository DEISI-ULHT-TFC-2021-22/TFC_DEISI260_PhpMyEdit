2002-07-28
- OK guys, after few months of project inactivity, we are going to move
  this thing on; my name is Ondrej Jombik, I'm from Slovakia and I believe
  in productive cooperation

+-+-+-+-+ Changes by Jim Kraai & John McCreesh follow

2002-02-07
	Added support for $fdd['field']['values']['db']
	Replace call to mysql_fetch_assoc with mysql_fetch_array in PME Setup
05-Feb-02
	Tore explicit date support from PME out of frustration
	(will tackle this later)
	timestamps are still read-only

04-Feb-02
	Fixed logtable schema in PHPMyEditSetup.php

30-Jan-02
	Changed filters to use strings instead of arrays

29-Jan-02
	Added support for $fdd[col][values]['filters'] when selecting
	  values from another table
	Added support for 'graphic' links

28-Jan-02
	Added ability to turn off displaying current sort and/or filters
	  in generated include file
	Added nowrap to action (first) column if 'link' style is used

25-Jan-02
	Added support for MySQL enum type
	Added support for MySQL set type
	Fixed bug with sort field number zero
	Fixed bug in PME Setup w/ wrong name to support language labels
	  in generated .inc file
	Fixed bug in PME Setup where generated file was including non-existent
	  header/footer files
	Added support in PME Setup for default values MySQL derived
	  from MySQL table description
	Fixed date edit form display bug
	Added another action--Display Detail.
	In $opts['options'], it's an 'E' and is on by default

24-Jan-02 - 4.001b1 Many Changes
	Added support for a calculated column requires:
		$fdd['other']['name']='Col Header';
		$fdd['other']['expression']='onHand-ordered';
		$fdd['other']['sort']='T:!';
		$fdd['other']['select']='T';
		$fdd['other']['type']='int';
		'other' can be anything, but multiple ones in a single
		       file need to be unique
		'expression' can be any valid MySQL expression
		'type' should reflect the results of the expression,
		       e.g. 'int' or 'string'
		all other options work as with other, normal columns
		this kind of column is always read-only
    Most of these changes were motivated by using PME in two 
    medium sized projects.
    Setup renamed to PHPMyEditSetup.php
    Setup Added functionality:
    Ascertains field type from mysql database
    Setup displays and attempts to write two files.
    These files are written to a configurable directory.
    PHPMyEdit.inc Added functionality:
    Date and Number filter fields now have in/equality operators
    Major date handling changes:
      Dates now handled with multiple input fields
      Specifiable date ranges (within year ranges only)
	  see 'daterange' option
        
    Can set listing limit to -1 (all rows on page)
    Can have multiple initial sort fields which are retained
	  as secondary/tertiary/quaternary/etc sort fields during normal usage
    'format' option is deprecated in favor of two new options:
        'datemask' is a PHP date style date format that supports
		           a few of the date macros
        'mask' is processed by printf() before displaying
    'daterange' accepts a range of years
    'maxwidth' is a new option that limits the width of filter fields
    'URL' options have been expanded, maybe too far for security comfort
    'options' have been expanded to recognize additional params
        R -- read-only
        P -- password field
        H -- hidden field
    Not for the faint of heart, trigger support has been added,
	see discussion in home page docs.
	Initial filters capability has been added, also not for the faint
	  of heart. Flexibility was chosen at the cost of ease of use
    Default field values are now supported
    Updates to a table can now be logged to another table
	Call to $MyForm -> execute() moved to end of the PME class initializer
	  because it always gets executed then anyway
	Previously unidentified bug fixed where if the coder had referred
	  to the same ['values']['table'] for two different fields would pull
	  (and update) based on the last use of the referenced table.
	  Changed all implicit joins to LEFT OUTER JOINs.
    Bug fix where addslashes() wasn't complimented by strip
    Bug fix where filtering didn't work where there were slashes
	in the data
    Started moving to single function which generates SELECT statements

06-May-01 - 3.5 multilingual version - you can now change all
    the displayed text to your local language. 
    Limited ability to customise the format used for displaying and 
    entering dates (d/m/y, m/d/y, d.m.y etc). However, dates in filters
    must still be entered in MySQL format.
    Fixed some bugs introduced when support of column names containing
    special characters or reserved words was added (e.g. using 'Date' as
    a column name). Note - database and table names may not contain
    special characters or reserved words.
    Changed handling of 'Cancel' button
	(thanks Bret <mogul@gealtinous.com>)

23-Apr-01 - 3.4 added 'More' button to 'Add' screen to make it easier
    to enter multiple records.

23-Apr-01 - 3.3 fixed bug which prevented 'Next' button working
    when filter had been activated (oops).

18-Apr-01 - 3.2 added ['select'] = 'M' to allow Multiple values
    to be selected in a drop-down list in a filter. The number of values
	displayed is set by $multiple (default = 4).

    NOTE - $multiple has been added to the call to PHPMyEdit, so this
    release is not compatible with calling programs produced by earlier
    releases of SETUP.PHP (sorry).

20-Mar-01 - 3.1 added ['options'] to provide full control over
    which fields appear on the List, Add, Change, and Delete screens.
	This replaces 'listview', which no longer works with this release
	- i.e. ['options']='ACD' has the same effect as ['listview']=true.

27-Feb-01 - 3.0 PHPMyEdit converted to PHP classes
    by Pau Aliagas <pau@newtral.com>.
    This new version will not work with calling programs created by older
    versions of SETUP.PHP - you will need to run SETUP.PHP again (sorry).
    Added $options='I'  - to display records from the table with the
    Initial sort suppressed (useful if you have a very large table with 
    no indexes).

14-Feb-01 - 2.3 added ['description'] option to ['values']. 
    This considerably enhances PHPMyEdit's ability to handle multiple
	tables in a seamless manner. It also involved a lot of new code,
	so 2.3 should be considered as more risky than the well-tested 2.2.

10-Feb-01 - 2.2 generate javascript to ensure user enters values
    for fields marked as 'required'. SETUP.PHP now marks 'not_null'
	fields as 'required' by default.
	(by Yusuf Kursat Tuncel <kursat@ttnet.net.tr>)
    PHPMyEdit.PHP now no longer requires 'sort_open_tag' to be set to
    false.

    NOTE - to use the filter functionality, you must now have 'F' in
    $OPTIONS in your calling program. This is set automatically by
    SETUP.PHP in version 2.2, BUT IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE (sorry).

02-Feb-01 - 2.1 suppress display of selected fields from the list
    display but still allow editing with "listview" property.
	(by Linas Jakucionis <linas@rl.lt>)

12-Jan-01 - 2.0 added filter functionality based on an idea from Chris.

02-Jan-00 - 1.9 fixed minor bug in display of blank fields as textareas

21-Dec-00 - 1.8 clicking a second time on a column heading causes
    the sort order to be reversed
	(thanks to Paolo Petrini <paolo.petrini@gib.it>)
    Support multi-line textareas (thanks again to Chris Navas)

19-Dec-00 - 1.7 removed restriction that key field must be numeric
    with $key_type parameter. Also fixed that not all browsers let you
	get away with <input disabled...>.

17-Dec-00 - 1.6 split out php and php3 versions. 
    SETUP.PHP now prompts for the field to be used as a key. 
    PHPMyEdit can now populate drop down lists from a field in a table.

11-Dec-00 - 1.5 included a local version of an in_array function
    so PHP Version 3 users can use the program
	(thanks to <ivo@ibuildings.nl> for the code).

10-Dec-00 - 1.4 Added support for textareas to SETUP.PHP and PHPMyEdit.
    Merci beaucoup Chris Navas <chris@arbo.com> pour ce petit truc.

08-Dec-00 - 1.3 SETUP is now a bit prettier to look at. PHPMyEdit.PHP
    now allows you to store HTML etc inside a table (previously it
	stripped out anything that looked like code). Note that it displays
	HTML as HTML - e.g. if you store <b>this</b> in a table, that's how
	it will appear on the screen - not 'this' in bold type.

03-Dec-00 - 1.2 rather more elegant solution to SETUP.PHP problem already
    fixed temporarily in 1.1.
    Added warning to SETUP.PHP if PHP is not configured correctly for XML.
    Added support for "URL" parameter to SETP.PHP and PHPMyEdit.PHP, 
    to allow 'clickable' links to email, web, ftp, etc. addresses.
    Improved handling of magic_quotes within PHPMyEdit.PHP.

29-Nov-00 - 1.1 temporary fix to glaring bug which prevented SETUP.PHP
    working with protected MySQL databases


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

phpMyEdit
---------

1. Overview

    How many times have you hand coded a MySQL table editor in PHP?
    phpMyEdit application provides an instant table editor.
    
    phpMyEdit generates PHP code for displaying/editing MySQL tables
    in HTML. All you need to do is to write a simple calling program
    (a utility to do this is included). It includes a huge set of
    table manipulation functions (record adition, change, view, copy,
    and remove), table sorting, filtering, table lookups, and more.

2. Installation

    For quick installation follow these steps:

    1. Extract phpMyEdit distribution archive.
    2. Copy/ftp/whatever them to your development web site.
    3. Using a browser, run phpMyEditSetup.php to log on
       to your MySQL server.
    4. Select a database, table and table key.
    5. Script phpMyEditSetup.php will attempt to write one file
       and it will also display that file on the screen.
    6. If the file write to the directory where the files were to be 
       written fails, copy it into your PHP editor, save it to a file, 
       and then run it in the same directory that you used for 
       phpMyEdit.class.php file.

    Portions of the generated PHP file are commented and described.
    However phpMyEdit has amount of available features, so if there is
    anything you do not understand, look into official phpMyEdit
    documentation.

3. Documentation

    phpMyEdit comes with extensive and exhaustive documentation in SGML,
    HTML and PDF format with huge amount of options, possibilities and
    information described. It is available for download as a separate
    package from phpMyEdit homepage or its project management page.

4. Homepage and download

    The official phpMyEdit homepage is:
    http://www.phpMyEdit.org

    The phpMyEdit project management page is:
    http://platon.sk/projects/main_page.php?project_id=5 

    You can download the latest version in "Download" sections
    of these pages.

5. Bug reporting and support

    I'm happy to accept bug reports, feature requests, suggestions for
    improvement, or improved code, preferably via our Platon.SK project
    management interface where everyone can see them.

    If you are submitting a bug report, please include the main table
    schema (mysqldump -d [database_name] [table_name]), schema for
    supporting ['values']['table'] tables, and the contents of the
    generated PHP file in your bug report. Also be sure to strip out
    database host/user/password info from the generated file.

    There is also discussion forum available for asking support
    questions or brainstorming about new features. phpMyEdit has also
    its own mailinglist and CVS repository. All these issues are
    described in official documentation.

    Commercial support is also available; see http://phpMyEdit.org
    for more detailed information.

6. Developers

    This project was the brain child of John McCreesh who has now moved
    on to other, more pressing projects. Mr. McCreesh had the foresight
    and fortitude to put together an excellent framework. Second project
    maintainer was Jim Kraai who puts a lot of wonderful feature basis
    and continues development in created framework.
    
    Many thanks to all those who have contributed code, notes or bug
    reports. Special thanks belongs to Pau Aliagas <pau@newtral.com>
    who converted phpMyEdit to PHP class in version 3.0.

    Current maintainer is Ondrej Jombik with help from various phpMyEdit
    community contributors. See doc/ChangeLog for credits.

If you have some time, I will appreciate if you could perform some tests to
ensure that phpMyEdit is working right with every table.

[1] Access generated script. Press "Search". Remember number of displayed
records and the whole look of the page. Now press "Query". The page should look
the same (of course except thing, that filter is opened) and the number of
displayed record should not change.

[2] Ensure you have $opts['display']['query'] enabled. Access generated script.
Make some filtering. Click on the "Clear" link in the query line. You will be
purpously moved to the first page. Click on the "Next". You should get the page
no. 2.


phpMyEdit TODO list
-------------------

* change SQL table aliases from "TableN" to "phpMyEdit_table_alias_N" or
  something similar
  - done with "PMEtableN" and "PMEjoinN" for lookup tables
* filter should be allowed only if $opts['options'] contains 'F'
- multi-part date handling
  - finish converting date handling to internal date handling functions
  - abstract date field gathering to get rid of _many_ redundant lines of code
  - there was some kludged fix for dateformat'ting where '%'s are removed
  - better support for more date format macros
  - better documentation for valid date format macros
- aggregates - firstly make specification and than implement such feature(s)
- data validation: expand JS field validation to match JS regexes
- data validation: create PHP field validation to match PHP regexes

* do_add_record() triggers - change $vals_ori to $vals and $vals to $vals_quoted
  - $vals_ori changed to $values
* do_add_record() triggers - make $vals available also in "before" trigger

- template based control of add/change/copy/view/delete record page; maybe also
  control of list page
* add ['display']['form'] parameter to control HTML <FORM> and </FORM> tag;
  policy for this: if missing => display form, if not and true => display form,
  if not missing and false => do not display form

* array compatible "sort_field" option to have possibility of default sorting
  according to more than one table column
* fix sorting problem when using table lookup with divs (separator)
* if picture/text links enabled, use texts for filter/search/hide buttons
* create URL links also in record view/delete

- fix this: `filters' option works fine, but when there is column with the same
  name in main table and also in join table, it must be prefixed by table alias
  (TableX.); prefixation with table name of course does not work; maybe note
  should be added into this option to use aliases, because this is difficult to
  fix without CPU expensive SQL parser
* add original variables which will persist whole session support
  - implemented via ['cgi']['persist']
* reimplement actionStyle to have possibility spefify where you want navigation
  buttons (up, down or both) and/or image/text action links
* implement repeating save in change operation (after repeating save is change
  record displayed again instead of table listing)
  - "Apply" function works fine
* extend patch from Shaun Johnston and add divs['-1'] to implement prefix and
  divs[$n + 1] to implement postfix


* what is difference between default_sort_columns and sort_field
  - not important now, default_sort_columns remove and sort_field brings amount
    of usable features, check doc/ChangeLog file for more information
* after save of records, fields are incorrectly displayed (in example
  Description field in Authors is showed)
  - nasty bug created in 4.x, fixed and works fine
* URLtarget to specify URL target

* links and buttons - booth used for records manipulating is not good
  idea?
  - good idea, implemented, use `navigation' option key for this
* when using images or links instead of buttons, change and delete links
  are constructed with English words (not national):
	http://example.com/authors.php?sfn=0&fl=0&fm=0&operation=Change&rec=1
	http://example.com/authors.php?sfn=0&fl=0&fm=0&operation=Delete&rec=1
  Than it is impossible to change or delete record via links. Other
  functions such as view and copy works well.
  - fixed, works fine

* images should be transparent, and not GIFs but PNGs
+ path prefix specification to graphic image styles
+ default sort columns are cool, but is there a way to specify
  descending ordering? In this case empty strings goes first and
  I want them at the end of list

* value of 0 in number of records to display on the screen will cause
  "Division by zero" error; so this should have the same functionality
  as -1 (display all records)
  - fixed

* according to language uand settings use htmlentities()
  or htmlspecialchars()
  - problematic htmlentities() is not used anymore

+ abbility to take more than one column from external table when using
  optional description field;
  Example:
  I have a table of authors with surname and firstname fields.
  I have also table of articles with author_id field.
  I want during adding new article to select from authors, but not only
  by surname, but by both, surname and firstname.
  Posible solutions:
  1. specify one field '@concat(surname, ', ', firstname)
  2. specify by array
  Although this seems to be difficult to implement.

+ ability to resize set of values from external table about value 'not set'
  Example:
  I have table of organizations.
  I have table of users with organization_id field.
  Every user may be in organization, but he/she mustn't.
  So I wanted to select from organization table names or select nothing and
  than organization_id will be 0.
  - implemented via ['values2']

+ security hole with View (remove View ability and use operation=View, it will
  also give you a view ability)
  - should be checked
+ the same with Change (after saving, records will be surprisingly added)
  - should be fixed

* allow to set CSS's clases for <td> (odd and even), <th>, <table>, <a>, etc
- multiple primary key support
- M:N joins support and similary sets support 
+ allow to select any combination of description columns when makes join; eval()
  should be used for this purpose to allow also some simple data transforming
  - implemented via ['description']['columns'] and ['description']['divs']
    but should be re-thought and changed
* $inc sets to 0 means unlimited

* implementation of view action - requires change of $labels, but it is
  neccessary
* column ability to be showed and read-only in add/edit screen
  (example of use: description column of property/config table)
+ fix page number after search (that means: I'm on page 4/50, I search for
  some records and result is a few in example 5 records, all of these 5 records
  are able to fill 1 page, but I will be after search on page 4/1 - that's
  really strange)
  - need testing
* fast moving between list pages (pulldown menu with page numbers)
+ $where variable in options to specify where clausule for working only
  with subset of data
  - to have ability of setting up particular filter anc do not need to enter
    filtering value in add or other forms
- data removing protection - delete will only mark record as deleted
  - hint: can be handled in triggers, however no one have this tested yet
